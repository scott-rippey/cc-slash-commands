description: Load recent session history to pick up where you left off
---

Read `docs/SESSION_LOG.md` and catch me up on recent work.

**Instructions:**

1. Read `docs/SESSION_LOG.md`
2. Focus on the last 5 entries
3. Give me a brief verbal summary:
   - What was the last thing worked on?
   - What was marked as "next"?
   - Any patterns or ongoing threads across recent sessions?

4. Ask: "Ready to continue with [the next item], or working on something different today?"

**Keep it conversational** — don't just dump the log contents back at me. Synthesize and be helpful.

**If the file doesn't exist:**
Say "No session log found yet. What are we working on today? I'll start tracking with /log when you're ready."
