description: Create a new slash command file
---

I want to create a new slash command.

1. Ask me what I want to call it (lowercase, hyphens for spaces)
2. Ask me what I want it to accomplish in plain language
3. Take my description and structure it into clear instructions for Claude - use the other `.md` files in this folder as reference for tone and format
4. Save it as `[name].md` in this folder

Help me turn my idea into a well-structured prompt.
